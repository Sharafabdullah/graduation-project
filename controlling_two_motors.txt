Salamulalikum
I'm Sharaf Makahleh, a fourth year computer engineering student at just university. I have been recognized in 2021 as being one of the top performing students in the Tawjihi exam. 

Since then, I entered computer engineering to follow my passion. Where I have secured first place in many regional and national competitions.

I love learning, and I aim to transfer this knowledge to others.

That is why I am a coach and volunteer at the ACM community and IEEE computer science chapter in my university. 

I have volunteered as a coach and organizer in almost every programming training and contest that has happened in my university. 
I have also been fortunate lately to be an Ambassador for JUST university in the IEEE Grandtech conference.

I think TedxAmman aligns with my goal of helping people learn and be innovative, that is why I'll be more than happy to be accepted as a volunteer

thank you for you time.
